This repo contains the backtesting environment for the IMC Prosperity 2 challenge, as well as the trading algorithm for each round.

The details of the challenge can be found in the Prosperity Wiki: https://imc-prosperity.notion.site/Prosperity-2-Wiki-fe650c0292ae4cdb94714a3f5aa74c85.

The data available for the challenges at each round $n$ is stored in the directories "round-n-island"/"round-n-island-data-bottle". 

The complete dataset, available after the completion of each round, is stored in the directory "data". The prices from days -2 (tutorial round) to day 5 (available after round 5) are available, with the exception of day 1 (available after round 1).

The datamodel.py file is copied from the Prosperity Wiki. 

The Jupyter notebooks can be ignored, as they are only used to analyse the data and develop some functions quickly.
